# The project

This project consists of the back-end for the WIE project of 2021 semester n.4

## Configurations

In order to make everything work, the config_example.json in the ./config folder has to be copied and renamed to "config.json" and the json has to be filled.

To start just run "npm start".

If it does not work try the following:

1. run "npm install -g node-dev"
